A cool way of looking at a TO-DO App. We simplified everything into one screen where you will have 99% of your activity. Changing task or creating one will happen in the same space, NO EXTRA screens or fragments popping out to change the most simple things. The task-like sentences get associated with Emojis by the fine-tuned GPT-2 Model with just 124M parameters!

The UI is simple, but elegant. The app is as intuitive as possible, you can't get something simpler than this.

The other 1% of teh activity will be spent in the statistical screen where you can track your process over time.

This project is still in active development, changes to code and logic appearing day by day.

If you want to work on this project, make sure you can run Android Studio(doesn't matter if you have the emulator testing available, although highly recommended), have basic Java knowledge(additionally SQL or Kotlin will be appreciated) and be eager to learn!
